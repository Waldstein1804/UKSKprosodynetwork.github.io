# UK-South Korea Prosody Research Network

This project will establish a new international network of psychologists, linguists, and phoneticians with the common goal of extending our understanding of the human faculty for the production, perception and cognitive processing of speech prosody. This academic network, with core members in the UK and South Korea, will promote and facilitate further cross-linguistic and interdisciplinary research. 

The objectives of the project are to:
- support long-term collaboration and exchange between researchers in the UK and South Korea;
- establish and maintain an interdisciplinary network of researchers to share skills and knowledge in collaborating in speech prosody research;
- provide training and mentoring opportunities for early career researchers;
- diversify target languages and populations in prosody research;
- improve analytical tools and research methods for prosody studies;
- promote and share good practice in open science;
- increase the impact of prosody research in pedagogy and other applied areas; and
- establish a basis for future world-leading research collaborations.

## Workshop I. Methodological Advances in Prosody Research
##### 28 June Tuesday - 4 July Monday 2022, Seoul National University, South Korea  
Venue information will be sent to face-to-face participants. 

### Call for student/early career researcher papers
We are planning a student and early career researcher forum for postgraduate students and early career researchers to present and discuss their work with the network members and workshop attendees. The event will be on **4th July Monday at Seoul National University.** 

If you would like to deliver a 20-minute presentation (in English), please send an abstract (max 1 page A4 including title, your name(s), affiliation(s), and references, Word file, with 2cm margins, Arial, font size 12pt, Single line spacing) to Hae-Sung Jeon (HJeon1 at uclan.ac.uk) by **15th June**. If you cannot physically attend the networking event, online participation is possible from anywhere in the world. The event will be in the morning in Korea. We hope that this forum will provide a useful networking opportunity -- the presentation can be about a research plan, a pilot study, or a publication/thesis in preparation.
